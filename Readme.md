## About

 Slate is/was a single day hack project that was intended to be a kickstarter, however I ran out of time so now it's a partially-implemented IRC client! I had pretty lofty goals but unfortunately there's not enough time to go around, there are still many features missing, and it's not quite in a usable state, but with some community interest and love maybe it will get there some day!

## Usage

 - press `?` to display the shortcut dialog

## Building

 Install node, [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and clone the repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:slate/slate.git
```

 Build and run with:

```
$ make
```

  Build with:

```
$ make build
```

  Continuous build with:

```
